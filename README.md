# HelloGitHub
Standing on the toes of midgets, in the great tradition of Hello World
applications.

## Build

Just type `make` and wish that your make is GNU make and you have a working
C++ compiler compatible with the make file installed.

If everything goes well, the moon still circles the earth and earth circles
the sun and sun keeps shining. And... you will be given the program
`greatgreeter` for the great benefit of yours.

## Installation

Are you kidding me?

	Hello, anonymous hipster!!
	$ ./greatgreeter Hamster
	Hello, Hamster!
	$ ./greatgreeter Crytographically Salted Onion Salad
	Hello, Crytographically Salted Onion Salad!
